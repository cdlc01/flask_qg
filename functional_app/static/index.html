              id: this is used on the front end to link the label to the input
              name: this is used on the back end when you submit the form; it
                becomes the key in the params dictionary
              value: this is the default value of the input. not necessary but
                helpful for speeding up demos

              The <br>s between each label/input combo are a quick and easy way
              to put each one on its own line. They aren't necessary for the
              form to function but they help the flow without needing a lot of
              nested <div>s to achieve the desired layout

          Welcome To The Hate Speech Predictor Application 
        </p>
        <p>
          This app predicts whether a given tweet is hate speech or not (you can leave the hashtags and mentions in there, it looks at those too)
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, this hate speech predictor is especially designed to work with hate tweets within the past few years (according to the FBI and 
          multiple groups, hate crimes and speech have been on the rise since approximately 2014). This application will continue to grow and evolve as more
          hate speech (and non hate speech is fed into it)
